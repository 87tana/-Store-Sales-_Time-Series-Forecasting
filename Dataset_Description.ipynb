    "**Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "Forecasts aren’t just for meteorologists. Governments forecast economic growth. Scientists attempt to predict the future population. And businesses forecast product demand—a common task of professional data scientists. Forecasts are especially relevant to brick-and-mortar grocery stores, which must dance delicately with how much inventory to buy. Predict a little over, and grocers are stuck with overstocked, perishable goods. Guess a little under, and popular items quickly sell out, leading to lost revenue and upset customers. More accurate forecasting, thanks to machine learning, could help ensure retailers please customers by having just enough of the right products at the right time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Current subjective forecasting methods for retail have little data to back them up and are unlikely to be automated. The problem becomes even more complex as retailers add new locations with unique needs, new products, ever-transitioning seasonal tastes, and unpredictable product marketing.\n",

    "**DataSet Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Train Data (csv):**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The training data, comprising time series of features store_nbr, family, and onpromotion as well as the target sales.\n",
    "\n",
    "store_nbr identifies the store at which the products are sold.\n",
    "\n",
    "family identifies the category of product sold.\n",
    "\n",
    "sales give the total sales for a product family at a particular store at a given date. Fractional values are possible since products can be sold in fractional units (1.5 kg of cheese, for instance, as opposed to 1 bag of chips).\n",
    "\n",
    "onpromotion gives the total number of items in a product family that were being promoted at a store on a given date.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Test Data (csv):**\n",
    "The test data has the same features as the training data. Target sales will be predicted for the dates in this file. The dates in the test data are for the 15 days after the last date in the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Sample Submission Data (csv):**\n",
    "The sample submission data is a file which contains examples of how the submission file should be presented after a model has been built.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Stores Data (csv):**\n",
    "The stores metadata contains the city, state, type and cluster grouping of similar stores\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Transactions Data (csv):**\n",
    "The transactions data contains date, store_nbr and the number of transactions made on each date. The relationship between the transactions data and sales column of the train data would be investigated to identify any correlations\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Holidays and Events Data (csv):**\n",
    "This data includes Holidays and Events with metadata. Special attention would be paid to the transferred column. A holiday that is transferred officially falls on that calendar day but was moved to another date by the government. A transferred day is more like a normal day than a holiday. To find the day that it was actually celebrated, look for the corresponding row where the type is Transfer. For example, the holiday Independencia de Guayaquil was transferred from 2012-10-09 to 2012-10-12, which means it was celebrated on 2012-10-12. Days that are type Bridge are extra days that are added to a holiday (e.g., to extend the break across a long weekend). These are frequently made up by the type Work Day which is a day not normally scheduled for work (e.g., Saturday) that is meant to pay back the Bridge. Adittional holidays are days added to a regular calendar holiday, for example, as typically happens around Christmas (making Christmas Eve a holiday).\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Oil Data (csv):**\n",
    "This data contains the daily oil price including values during both train and test data timeframes. Ecuador is an oil-dependent country and its economic health is highly vulnerable to shocks in oil prices.\n",
